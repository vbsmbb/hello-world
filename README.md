# hello-world

I am Mike Shelton and I am a retired DBA. Most recently, I consulted to the ALDOT organization in Montgomery, AL. I am an experienced Oracle administrator in versions from 9i to 19c and I am also a skillful database developer. I have worked with SQL Server in versions from 2008 to 2017 and designed and developed many SSIS modules. Today, I am playing and working on my own projects.
